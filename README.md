## Synopsis

The goal of this project is to provide insight into League of Legends players’ experience on current champions and their effects on the likelihood of a match victory to allow user to identify where extra aid will be best utilized on user’s team and strategize against the enemy team’s strengths and weakness.

**Vision**
Allow a user to input their summoner's name (gamer tag) to display a current match's players and champion experience levels. By pulling match histories, the user can see the win rates, average KDA (Kills/Deaths/Assists) ratios, and number of games played on the current champion for each player. From these statistics, the web app will give the odds of the user winning the current match (and whether the user should surrender at 20 minutes).

**Mission**
Provide insight into players’ experience on current champions and its effects on the likelihood of victory. This will identify where extra aid will be best utilized on user’s team (more help given to less experienced team members based on their champions) and strategize against the enemy team’s strengths and weakness in player experience.

**Success Criteria**
A summary of players’ stats on current champions along with a predicted win rate, with an accuracy of 70% (training on past, completed matches).


## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.
