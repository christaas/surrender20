## Synopsis

The goal of this project is to provide insight into League of Legends players’ experience on current champions and their effects on the likelihood of a match victory to allow user to identify where extra aid will be best utilized on user’s team and strategize against the enemy team’s strengths and weakness.

**Vision**

Allow a user to input a summoner's name (gamer tag) or choose a random Challegner-tier game to display a current match's champion statistics. By looking at aggregated champion statistics, the user can see the win rates, average KDA (Kills/Deaths/Assists) ratios, and the overall power for each current champion. From these statistics, the web app will give the odds of each team winning the current match (and whether a team should surrender at 20 minutes).

**Mission**

Provide insight into the current state of League of Legends' champions and its effects on the likelihood of victory. This will identify where extra aid will be best utilized on user’s team (more help given to less experienced team members based on their champions) and strategize against the enemy team’s strengths and weakness in player experience.

**Success Criteria**

A predicted win rate for a current match with an accuracy of 70% (training on past, completed matches), along with a feature to allow the player to spectate that game and see if the result is the same as predicted.
